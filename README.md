# SVETlANNa

SVETlANNa is an open-source Python library for simulation of free-space optical set-ups and neuromorphic systems such as Diffractive Neural Networks. It is primarily built on the PyTorch framework, leveraging key features such as tensor-based computations and efficient parallel processing. At its core, SvetlANNa relies on the Fourier optics, supporting multiple propagation models, including the Angular spectrum method and the Fresnel approximation.

There is a supporting github project [SVETlANNa.docs](https://github.com/CompPhysLab/SVETlANNa.docs) containing numerous application examples in the Jupyter notebook format.

The name of the library is composed of the Russian word "svet", which is the "light" in English and the abbreviation ANN standing for an artificial neural network, and simultaneously the whole word sounds like a Russian female name Svetlana.

## Abbreviations

NN - Neural Network

ANN - Artificial Neural Network

ONN - Optical Neural Network

DONN - Diffractive Optical Neural Network

DOE - Diffractive Optical Element

SLM - Spatial Light Modulator

## Features

- based on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- forward propagation models include the Angular spectrum method and the Fresnel approximation
- possibility to solve the classical DOE/SLM optimization problem with the Gerchberg-Saxton and hybrid input-output algorithms
- support for custom elements and optimization methods
- support for various free-space ONN architectures including feed-forward NN, autoencoders, and recurrent NN
- cross platform
- full GPU aceleration
- companion repository with numerous .ipynb examples
- custom logging, project management, analysis, and visualization tools
- tests for the whole functionality

## Possible applications

- modeling and optimization of optical systems and optical beams propagating in free space;
- calculation of parameters of phase masks, DOEs and SLMs for both classical optical systems and neuromorphic optical computers;
- modeling and optimization of parameters of ONN and DONN for problems of all-optical classification and prediction.

# Installation, Usage and Examples

For usage there are two options, either run from the source or install from pip.

## Installation From PyPI

```bash
pip install svetlanna
```

## Running From Source

We reccomend first to install [git](https://git-scm.com) in your system.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/CompPhysLab/SVETlANNa.git
```
2. Move to the project dyrectory:
```bash
  cd SVETlANNa
```
3. Create a virtual environment for Python 3.11 (see [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)) and activate it.
4. Istall the Poetry (version 2.0.0 or greater):
```bash
  pip install poetry
```
5. Install all depencies:
```bash
  poetry install --all-extras
```
6. Install the PyTorch (check the instructions at the official [cite](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)). Choose options appropriate to your system. For running the library on a GPU you need to have an appropriate graphic card and a PyTorch version which supports this card.
```bash
  pip install torch
```

## Running Tests

The tests can be executed when the library is running from source only. PIP istallation does not include tests.

NOTE: running tests requires at least 4 Gb of free memory.

To run tests, run the following command (within the activated virtual environment in the library folder)
```bash
  pytest
```

## Examples

Result of training the feed-forward optical neural network for the MNIST classification task: The image of the figure "8" is passed through a stack of 10 phase plates with adjusted phase masks. Selected regions of the detector correspond to different classes of figures. The class of the figure is identified by the detector region that measures the maximum optical intensity.
